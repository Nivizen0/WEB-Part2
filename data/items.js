    title: "Black Holes",
    desc: "Black holes are regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape. Formed from the collapse of massive stars, these cosmic phenomena warp space and time itself. The Event Horizon Telescope captured the first image of a black hole in 2019, revolutionizing our understanding of these mysterious objects.",
